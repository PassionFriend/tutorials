# Getting Started with Animate.css

To get started with Animate.css, add
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.5.2/animate.min.css">`
to your `<head>` tag. After that, you can now add the class to another tag. Example:

```html
<p class="animated bounce">Bouncy text!</p>
<!--And for looping-->
<p class="animated infinite bounce">I bounce until you make me stop!</p>
```
