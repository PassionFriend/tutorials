## Cdnjs Tutorials

### Overview

Do you think w3schools sucks? Do you think you could do a way better job? Now you can! Community driven, open source tutorials.

### Instructions

Simply fork the repository and copy the [example tutorial](https://github.com/cdnjs/tutorials/tree/master/backbone.js/organizing-backbone-using-modules)

Each tutorial should have a master `index.md` file which will contain the contents of your tutorial. And it should also contain a `tutorial.json` file which contains all the meta information about your tutorial.

We want to make a super beautiful and useful tutorial system where anyone can get setup in minutes.

## Tutorial Listings

Tutorials show under each associated library. At the moment we don't have to support for generic Javascript tutorials but please leave an issue if you want to write one.
